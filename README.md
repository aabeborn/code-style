# Aabeborn code styling repo :nail_care::cop::snowman:

Monorepo helps me (hahahahaha) to enforce the same code style inside the different projects.

## Structure

Based on `turborepo` the monorepo contains its packages under the `packages` folder.
Available packages are:

-   `eslint` contains the different eslint rules
-   `prettier` contains prettier configuration
-   `stylelint` contains stylelint rules
